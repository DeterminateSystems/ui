# `@determinate-systems/ui`

## Usage

The only special note here is that there is a bundled CSS file that needs to be imported alongside the usual React components. Most bundlers are able to ingest CSS, so this import statement should suffice:

```javascript
import "@determinate-systems/ui/reset.min.css";
import "@determinate-systems/ui/index.min.css";
```

And, add this to your `<head>` so fonts work:

```html
<link rel="preconnect" href="https://fonts.googleapis.com" />
<link rel="preconnect" href="https://fonts.gstatic.com" crossorigin />
<link
  href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Work+Sans:ital,wght@0,100..900;1,100..900&display=swap"
  rel="stylesheet"
/>
```

## Development

Run these two commands in two separate terminals. (Storybook needs to see the CSS, so it's better to have Rollup complete its CSS work.)

1. `npm run watch`
2. `npm run storybook`

Remember to use `npm run format:fix` to match Prettier's expected formatting style.

## Notes

The CSS generated by this includes the tailwind CSS reset sheet, `preflight`.
